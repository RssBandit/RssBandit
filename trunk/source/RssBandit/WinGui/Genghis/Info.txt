The recent required fixes for the used Genghis assembly were
included in recent Genghis release:
http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/releases/viewuploads.aspx?id=dfd0b577-2e97-4d21-90c4-6ca9d83e47ad

But: they designed the assembly to use CLR 2.0, so as long we did 
not swiched the main dev. to use also CLR 2.0 only, we only can
directly use the classes as sources to get the fixes.

Modifications required herein are only related to get them work again
for CLR 1.x (e.g. removing "partitial" from class declarations).
