RSS Bandit now has rich support for synchronization across multiple 
computers (version 1.2.0.112 and greater).  This comes in very handy 
when you use RSS Bandit on multiple computers such as from work and home.
</p>
<p>
<b>Why is this useful?</b><br/>
After a full day of work in which you spend some of that time reading feeds, it is a bit 
of an annoyance to come home and have to wade through all the items that you've already 
read to find the few new items you haven't yet read since you left work.
</p>
<p>
Now with the latest version of RSS Bandit, there are two key mechanisms for synchronizing RSS Bandit 
from multiple computers. The first option is to synchronize RSS Bandit with Web-based feed readers 
such as <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> and 
<a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>. The second option is to use a remote storage system 
and <b>Upload Feeds</b> before leaving and <b>Download Feeds</b> when you get home and your home 
RSS Bandit will have the same state (more or less) that RSS Bandit at work does.  
</p>

<p><b>How does synchronization via a Web-based feed reader work?</b><br/>
When you launch RSS Bandit your feed list downloaded from the Web-based feed reader. Each time 
you make changes such as marking an item as read, subscribing to a new feed, removing a feed, 
or renaming a feed, this change is quickly reflected on the Web-based feed reader. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, RSS Bandit periodically polls your Web-based feed reader so that if you make changes
via the Web they are eventually reflected in RSS Bandit as well. 
</p>

<b>So how do I start synchronizing with a Web-based feed reader?</b><br/>
<p>First you have to configure a new feed source.  Under the <b>File</b> menu select <b>Synchronize Feeds</b>.  
This will bring up the dialogue in figure 1.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../images/rssbandit_SynchronizeFeeds_Google.jpg"  alt="Figure 1: Synchronize Feeds" />
<br/><span class="figure">Figure 1: Synchronize Feeds Wizard.</span>
</p>
<p>
Then select your chosen Web-based feed reader. The following topices cover the various 
choices for synchronizing with a Web-based feed reader.
<ul>
	<li><a href="synchronization_using_google_reader.htm">Google Reader</a></li>
	<li><a href="synchronization_using_newsgator_online.htm">NewsGator Online</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>How does synchronization via remote storage work?</b><br/>
Sychronization data is transferred within a ZIP compressed file that contains information about 
the current state of your search folders, flagged items, replied items, subscribed feeds, and 
read/unread messages.
</p>
<p>
Please note that the actual feed content is not transferred, but rather the state of the 
feed content such as whether an item has been read or not.
</p>
<p>For example, suppose you read the latest riveting post from <a href="http://haacked.com/">http://haacked.com/</a> 
with the id <b>#123</b> on your home computer.  Being late for work, you hurriedly hit 
<b>CTRL+SHIFT+U</b> to upload your current state.  This uploads the fact that you've read item 
#123 on haack.org.  It does not upload the actual content of item #123.  Upon arriving at work and 
settling down with your morning coffee, you hit <b>CTRL+SHIFT+D</b> to download your state, 
you may notice that item #123 does not show up.  However, after refreshing your feeds by hitting 
<b>CTRL+F5</b>, RSS Bandit will download that item and it will appear as a read item rather than 
as a new item.
</p>
<p>
<b>So how do I start using remote storage?</b><br/>
First you have to configure <b>Remote Storage</b>.  Under the <b>Tools</b> menu select <b>Options</b> (
or hit <b>CTRL+O</b>).  Click on the <b>Remote Storage</b> tab.  This will bring up the dialogue in figure 2.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../images/rssbandit_RemoteFeedsDialogue.gif" width="408" height="484" alt="Figure 2: Remote Storage Dialogue" />
<br/><span class="figure">Figure 2: Remote Storage Dialog.</span>
</p>
<p>
In order to user Remote Storage, check the <b>Use Remote Storage</b> checkbox and select a 
protocol.  Depending on the chosen protocol, you will have to configure RSS Bandit with other 
information to allow it to synchronize your feeds.  The following topices cover the various 
choices for Remote Feeds.
<ul>
	<li><a href="synchronization_using_local_or_network_file.htm">File Share</a></li>
	<li><a href="synchronization_using_ftp.htm">FTP</a></li>
	<li><a href="synchronization_using_dasBlog_weblog.htm">DasBlog and DasBlog 1.3</a></li>
	<li><a href="synchronization_using_webDAV.htm">WebDAV</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Once you've selected a protocol that will work for you simply upload your feeds when you're done 
using RSS Bandit on one computer and download feeds when you begin to use it on another computer. 
You'll be in synchronirvana!
