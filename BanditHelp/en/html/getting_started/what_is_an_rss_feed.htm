 an RSS feed<!--kadov_tag{{</variable>}}--></h1>

<p>Put simply RSS is a format for <b>easily sharing content</b> on the 
 web. What type of content? Commonly things such as news items, job adverts, 
 or marketing communications are ideal candidates for RSS although almost 
 any list orientated information can be suitable.</p>

<h2>Fundamentals</h2>

<p>Some key points to be aware of from the outset include:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>The use of RSS <b>benefits everyone</b> involved 
 - for publishers and content providers details of new content can be accessed 
 by a much broader audience, for web site producers new content can be 
 easily integrated into web sites or portals, and for end users easy access 
 to new content is greatly facilitated.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>An RSS file (also known as an RSS feed or <b>RSS 
 channel</b>) consists of a <b>list of items</b>, each of which contains 
 a <b>title</b>, <b>description</b> and a <b>link</b> to a web page. Typically 
 the full content itself is made available separately and can be accessed 
 by the link in the RSS file.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>Utilising an RSS feed is straightforward. Once an 
 RSS file is made available on a web site, interested parties can simply 
 gather the file from the site and <b>reuse the content</b> in a variety 
 of ways. </li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>There are a number of <b>different versions</b> of 
 RSS. Although this has led to some confusion and debate it is not a major 
 issue as almost all RSS applications like Rss Bandit can handle any RSS 
 version.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>RSS can stand for '<b>Rich Site Summary</b>', '<b>RDF 
 Site Summary</b>' or '<b>Really Simple Syndication</b>' depending on who 
 you ask and which version they are speaking about.</li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p
		class=kadov-p>RSS is an <b>XML based format</b>. If you already 
 know a bit about HTML and XML then RSS will be a breeze!</li>
</ul>

<p>The terms <b>Syndication</b> and <b>Aggregation</b> are often used in 
 the context of RSS. Dictionary definitions of 'syndication' are along 
 the following lines:</p>

<blockquote>
'<i>Distributing</i>' a news article or picture through a syndicate for 
 publication in a number of newspapers or periodicals simultaneously. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
'<i>Syndication</i>' is often used in the context of RSS because it is 
 all about distributing content for reuse. 
</blockquote>

<p>Because RSS is an XML format and not simple HTML, RSS files must be 
 processed (or '<i>parsed</i>') before they can be displayed. On web sites 
 they are often visualized as links to the RSS file resource with a small 
 orange icon named XML or RSS: <img src="../../images/xml.gif"
									x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
									style="border: none;
											width: 36px;
											height: 14px;
											float: none;"
									width=36
									height=14
									border=0>. RSS aggregators like Rss 
 Bandit are applications which provide the means to read the content of 
 RSS files. </p>

<p>An RSS aggregator is a program that reads RSS documents and displays 
 new items. Most aggregators make it possible to subscribe to a feed by 
 simply entering the URL to the RSS document. See also <a HREF="subscribing_to_a_feed.htm">Subscribing 
 to a feed</a>.</p>

<p>Other types of applications can also take advantage of RSS to syndicate 
 content. For example, most of the major news sites including Wired, CNet, 
 Yahoo!, and NPR News provide RSS feeds. Check out <a href="http://www.blogdigger.com/"

 and <a href="http://www.syndic8.com/"

 in facilities</a> to find sites that support RSS.</p>

	target=_blank>RSS feeds</a> to syndicate news related to RSS Bandit 
 project. This is a great way to keep up with news and release downloads.
